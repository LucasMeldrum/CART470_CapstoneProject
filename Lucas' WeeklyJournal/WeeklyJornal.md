# Week 1

### Role and Design Thinking
My role in this project will be to focus on the development of the app and the functionality behind it. Focusing mainly on code and app development through API calls, backend development, database upkeep, etc. Using FlutterFlow, an app development software in which I have a lot of experience with, I will develop the prototypes and final iteration with the help of my partner. Furthermore, I will also aid in the design and UI/UX of the application with focus on the gamification and flow for users. Since our team is small we will both be working on similar scopes and complete tasks together using our coding and design skills that have been developping throughout all of university.

In regards to the design thinking approach, conducting user empathy immersion/obersation tests, user feedback tests and modifying based on these results will definetly be a focus from me throughout the entirety of this project. I would like to focus mainly on user participation feedback tests to secure what people need and how they react to certain elements the most.

### This Week's Work
This week I researched issues regarding screen time affecting different generations and how it impacts certain groups of people differently than others. I found that the situation is increasingly getting worse and is impacting my generation the greatest. I also helped create the project proposal and created the GitHub repo to organize our ideas and for when we begin the development of the app.

# Week 2

### Research, Empathy and Users
Before developping any prototypes or diving into the fundamentals of the app, our team took the time to research our user's and see how big of a problem screen time is to the individual. I personally created a survey and set it out to as many people to see to what degree the situation of screen time affects our generation.

### Results

Our results are seperated into quantitative and qualitative data. 

**Average user screen time:** 6 hours and 4 mins.
**Most used apps:** Messaging, calling facetiming.
**Second most used apps:** Social media.
**Third most used apps:** Shows/Movies.

Most people were **NOT** satisfied with their screen time and would much rather spend less time on their phones.

**EVERYONE** we surveyed find their phone very addicting and hard to stop even if they want to.

From these results we gained great insight on our generation, the struggles with their phone use and how most people want to stop being on their phones as much but find it difficult, like an addiciton. 

### Immersion
On top of the research we did with users, we (both my partner and I) immersed ourselves in what the app would be doing. We've been tracking our weekly screen time, competing agaist eachother to see who has the lowest. In doing so, I have lowered my screen time on my phone from an average of 6-8hrs down to 3hrs. A huge significant decrease and it has been steadily decreasing as time has gone on.

This immersion has helped us better understand what will work to help users lower their screen time and how people might enjoy the competitive nature of this app.

# Week 3

### Define
With our results from the previous week, both quantitative and qualitative our goal this week was to create a suitable problem statement that defines a clear user, need and goal. 

Using AI to parse through the information, we found repeating ideas that were significant to our research based on the responses. Prompting AI in a clear and non biasing way allowed for answers based on our users and not based on our predeterminations. Here were the results:

#### Key Ideas Derived from the Responses:

- Phone usage is habitual and often unconscious
Many people pick up their phone automatically or without intention.
- Addictive app design makes it difficult to stop.
- Social media and short-form content (e.g., TikTok, Reels) make users lose track of time.
- People rely on their phones for convenience, necessity, or boredom relief.
- Even when trying to cut back, tools like messaging, checking the weather, or reading still pull them in.
- Lack of motivation or discipline prevents change.
Users want to reduce screen time but struggle to maintain self-control or stick to resolutions.
- Fear of missing out (FOMO) or needing distraction keeps them hooked.
- Phones provide escape, stimulation, or a buffer against real responsibilities.
