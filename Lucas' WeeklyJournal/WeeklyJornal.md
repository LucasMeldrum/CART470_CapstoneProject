# Week 1

### Role and Design Thinking
My role in this project will be to focus on the development of the app and the functionality behind it. Focusing mainly on code and app development through API calls, backend development, database upkeep, etc. Using FlutterFlow, an app development software in which I have a lot of experience with, I will develop the prototypes and final iteration with the help of my partner. Furthermore, I will also aid in the design and UI/UX of the application with focus on the gamification and flow for users. Since our team is small we will both be working on similar scopes and complete tasks together using our coding and design skills that have been developping throughout all of university.

In regards to the design thinking approach, conducting user empathy immersion/obersation tests, user feedback tests and modifying based on these results will definetly be a focus from me throughout the entirety of this project. I would like to focus mainly on user participation feedback tests to secure what people need and how they react to certain elements the most.

### This Week's Work
This week I researched issues regarding screen time affecting different generations and how it impacts certain groups of people differently than others. I found that the situation is increasingly getting worse and is impacting my generation the greatest. I also helped create the project proposal and created the GitHub repo to organize our ideas and for when we begin the development of the app.

# Week 2

### Research, Empathy and Users
Before developping any prototypes or diving into the fundamentals of the app, our team took the time to research our user's and see how big of a problem screen time is to the individual. I personally created a survey and set it out to as many people to see to what degree the situation of screen time affects our generation. 

Link to the form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdl6C0oCfMHk6J4hh5uJL0eE9hF36W_8fCV8MQIIR-c7GZTiA/viewform?usp=dialog

### Results

Our results are seperated into quantitative and qualitative data. 

**Average user screen time:** 6 hours and 4 mins.
**Most used apps:** Messaging, calling facetiming.
**Second most used apps:** Social media.
**Third most used apps:** Shows/Movies.

Most people were **NOT** satisfied with their screen time and would much rather spend less time on their phones.

**EVERYONE** we surveyed find their phone very addicting and hard to stop even if they want to.

From these results we gained great insight on our generation, the struggles with their phone use and how most people want to stop being on their phones as much but find it difficult, like an addiciton. 

### Immersion
On top of the research we did with users, we (both my partner and I) immersed ourselves in what the app would be doing. We've been tracking our weekly screen time, competing agaist eachother to see who has the lowest. In doing so, I have lowered my screen time on my phone from an average of 6-8hrs down to 3hrs. A huge significant decrease and it has been steadily decreasing as time has gone on.

This immersion has helped us better understand what will work to help users lower their screen time and how people might enjoy the competitive nature of this app.

# Week 3

### Define
With our results from the previous week, both quantitative and qualitative our goal this week was to create a suitable problem statement that defines a clear user, need and goal. 

Using AI to parse through the information, we found repeating ideas that were significant to our research based on the responses. Prompting AI in a clear and non biasing way allowed for answers based on our users and not based on our predeterminations. Here were the results:

#### Key Ideas Derived from the Responses:

- Phone usage is habitual and often unconscious
Many people pick up their phone automatically or without intention.
- Addictive app design makes it difficult to stop.
- Social media and short-form content (e.g., TikTok, Reels) make users lose track of time.
- People rely on their phones for convenience, necessity, or boredom relief.
- Even when trying to cut back, tools like messaging, checking the weather, or reading still pull them in.
- Lack of motivation or discipline prevents change.
Users want to reduce screen time but struggle to maintain self-control or stick to resolutions.
- Fear of missing out (FOMO) or needing distraction keeps them hooked.
- Phones provide escape, stimulation, or a buffer against real responsibilities.

### Problem Statements
With the info gathered from our forms and AI prompting, we were able to determine 3 statements that seem to address the User, Need and Goal:

> Problem Statements:
>- How might we help Gen-Z reclaim time spent on their phones so they can enjoy their youth and spend time on things they want to do?
>- How might we make people more consistently aware of their screen time in order to help them make more informed decisions?
>- How might we address the addiction aspect of screen time and users' seeming inability to keep themselves off screens?

The first statement being the most well structured and defined under the scope of User/Need/Goal.

### Up Next
With a well defined problem statement and understanding our user's needs and goals, we are now able to begin iterating and coming up with ideas that will suit the app we are developping.

# Week 4

## Ideate: Exploring Possibilities Through Divergent Thinking

With a strong understanding of our users, their motivations, and our defined problem statement *helping Gen-Z reclaim time spent on their phones*, this week focused on **brainstorming a wide range of ideas** without constraints. Instead of evaluating or filtering, the goal was to **generate as many possibilities as possible**, keeping our past weeks in mind.

### Ideation Strategy Used
I chose to come up with as many ideas as possible and write down notes for each one. Doing this let my mind flow and wander wherever it wanted to go. This allows for many ideas and even bad ones to lead to ideas that are more developped.

### Raw Idea Generation (Unfiltered)

### 1. Gamification & Competition
- Daily and weekly screen time challenges
- Team-based competitions
- XP and level progression
- Unlockable avatars/themes
- Streak system
- “Phone-Free Quests”

### 2. Social Motivation & Accountability
- Accountability buddy system
- Group leaderboards
- Real-time comparison with friends
- Squad-based challenges
- Friend nudges/rewards

### 3. Addiction-Aware Design
- Delayed app entry (pause screens)
- Forced reflection screens
- “Is this intentional?” prompts
- Breathing countdown before entry
- Lock-out timers

### 4. Awareness & Tracking
- Real-time screen time widgets
- End-of-day habit summaries
- Usage heatmaps
- Pickup notifications
- Weekly breakdowns

## Top Ideas to Move Forward With

These concepts stood out as high-impact and feasible:

1. Competitive Screen Time Challenges (solo + friends)
2. Gamified Rewards, XP, and Streaks
3. Accountability Buddy or Squad Mode
4. Intentional App Entry (pause/delay screens)
5. Minimalist Distraction-Free Mode
6. Reflection Dashboard & Motivation Stats

These ideas will lead into **Week 5 prototyping and wireframing** where we can see what is feasible and work!
