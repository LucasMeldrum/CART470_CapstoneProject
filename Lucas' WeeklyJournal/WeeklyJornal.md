# Week 1

### Role and Design Thinking
My role in this project will be to focus on the development of the app and the functionality behind it. Focusing mainly on code and app development through API calls, backend development, database upkeep, etc. Using FlutterFlow, an app development software in which I have a lot of experience with, I will develop the prototypes and final iteration with the help of my partner. Furthermore, I will also aid in the design and UI/UX of the application with focus on the gamification and flow for users. Since our team is small we will both be working on similar scopes and complete tasks together using our coding and design skills that have been developping throughout all of university.

In regards to the design thinking approach, conducting user empathy immersion/obersation tests, user feedback tests and modifying based on these results will definetly be a focus from me throughout the entirety of this project. I would like to focus mainly on user participation feedback tests to secure what people need and how they react to certain elements the most.

### This Week's Work
This week I researched issues regarding screen time affecting different generations and how it impacts certain groups of people differently than others. I found that the situation is increasingly getting worse and is impacting my generation the greatest. I also helped create the project proposal and created the GitHub repo to organize our ideas and for when we begin the development of the app.
