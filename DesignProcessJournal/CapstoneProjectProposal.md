# Capstone Project Proposal

### Description
 Gen Z is seeing an unprecedented new addiction: screen time. With young people, including ourselves, spending anywhere from 3-7 hours per day on their phones, many different apps and self-improvement mantras have been trying to help. I, personally, have tried many different routes to decreasing my screen time, but have only found one that actually works: accountability. For our capstone, we are attempting to create a mobile application that can track and share screen time data across different users with the idea of gamification and a fun/interactive UI. The goal is to allow users a tool to better monitor their own and their friends' screen times to add accountability to addiction. 
 ## Designing for the Socialization of Self-Improvement
 Beyond this being just a screen time tracker, we are  planning on making your score shareable between friends. For a few months, our team has been taking part in a weekly screen time challenge where the person with the highest screen time each week loses the challenge. In all of our attempts to lower our screentime, this has been the only effective process. Our main design goal for this project is to create a virtual space where sociability and accountability build awareness of patterns. 
 ## Aspects of Design
 We will do more brainstorming and feasibility narrowing but roughly our app wil include:
 1. Front page interface describing screen time usage for the week and average weekly use (like on IOS devices)
 2. Social page to see the scores of friend accounts
 3. Visual calendar to track usage over longer periods of time (can hold up to months worth of tracking)

<br>

Furthermore, screen time will be organized into categories depending on what your phone has been used for. For example, Intstagram, Facebook, Reddit, etc. will be categorized into social media while Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, etc. will be put into navigation/maps. This seperation of categories is significant since certain apps have less active monitoring (such as a GPS or music) and are used while doing other tasks whilst others required your full attention.

### Timeline
  **Goals:**
  <br>
    Help people keep off their phones by comparing their screen time with others. We must research the best methods to achieve this through functional UI, databases to store information, displaying screen time through API calls and testing with real users using prototypes.

  September: 
  <br>
  - 17th- **Empathize I**: Plan and conduct at least two research activities.
             _Have Completed_: Finished proposal with research into a rough idea of what technologies we will be using. Have agreed upon game plan of scope and subgoals.        
  - 24th- **Empathize II**: Synthesis Workshop: Affinity, Personas, and journey mapping.
             _Have Completed_: Have received feedback about the scope and academic requirements for the project and made adjustments. Completed two research activities with real participants (topic interviews about needs). Finalized software and frameworks to use and begin building a system design strategy for implementation.
    
  October:
  <br>
  - 1st- **Define**: Problem statements and constraints
             _Have Completed_: Decide what prototype pieces are necessary for October 15th. Begin planning of small-scale prototypes that are usable for user testing. Mostly about back-end design and functionality.
  - 8th- **Ideate I**: Divergent Sketching- sketch 20 possible ideas and pick the top three most viable.
             _Have Completed_: Finalize what the app will actually be able to do. Divergent sketching activity is for front-end UI and user experience. Have framework of working prototype with limited front end OR have only front end to enable user testing.
  - 15th- **Ideate II: Prototype**: Refine builds, prepare test plan, TESTS CONDUCTED IN CLASS
             _Have Completed_: Have finalized the design of prototype front end in Figma- Non-functional but has all necessary components. Continue to work on backend system design. 
 - 29th- **Prototype 1**: Build low fidelity prototype.
             _Have Completed_: Have working prototypes of the front end for user testing. Have a feasible back-end system structure. Conduct testing and document design flaws. 

  November:
<br>
 - 5th- **Prototype 1**: Build low fidelity prototype.
             _Have Completed_: Have working prototypes of the front end for user testing. Have a feasible back-end system structure. Conduct testing and document design flaws.
 - 12th- **Iterate**: Iterate changes, risk and feasibility check, plan high fidelity build
             _Have Completed_: Refine front-end with info gained from prototype day. Have the backend be usable (sending correct data, real-time data display, downloadable on phone). Begin to combine front and back-end design. 
 - 19th- **High Fidelity Build**: High fidelity prototype, draft, and installation, peer critique
             _Have Completed_: Have the back and front end combined seamlessly. Conduct further user testing and risk/QA testing
 - 26th- **Rehearsal**: Narrative, demo logistics, finalize journal.
             _Have Completed_: Final debugging and user experience testing finished.
   
  December:
  <br>
  - TBD: **Final Presentations**
             _Have Completed_: Narrative hook, practiced presentation, have a working prototype on phones able to be shown. 

### Materials/Frameworks
For prototyping, using a widget-based framework such as Figma or Flutterflow will be advantageous since our UI will be a key component in the construction of this app. Our process will include roughly: 
1. Identifying user needs and interests of potential users in order to build a lightweight app that is simple but effective (deciding number and look of interfaces, deciding whether to create phone widget, deciding extent and process of socialization).
2. Building a wireframe prototype of the UI using Figma and testing usability with potential users
3. Building an action plan for backend database creation and the social mobility aspect. Researching potential API's for accessing settings data.
4. Building prototype of a completely working system structure, unpolished and rough.
5. Refining final prototype to show on project day. 
We will then need to emulate different mobile devices through a mobile emulator and test different API calls on each to make sure it is cross-compatible. Coding tools and API libraries will definitely be required, and to simplify workflow, we will be sharing the project on GitHub to facilitate teamwork. 

**Tools**: Flutterflow (app builder with UI and Backend capabilities), Figma (for UI creation and branding mood board), GitHub (version control, deployment and documentation)
