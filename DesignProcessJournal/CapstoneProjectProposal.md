# Capstone Project Proposal

### Description
 Create a mobile application that can track and share screen time data across different users with the idea of gamification and a fun/interactive UI.

### Timeline
  **Goals:**
  <br>
    Help people keep off their phone by comparing their screen time with others. We must research the best methods to achieve this through functional UI, databases to store information, displaying screen time through API calls and testing with real users using prototypes.

  September: 
  <br>
  - 17th- **Empathize I**: Plan and conduct at least two research activities.
             _Have Completed_: Finished proposal with research into a rough idea of what technologies we will be using. Have agreed upon game plan of scope and subgoals.        
  - 24th- **Empathize II**: Synthesis Workshop: Affinity, Personas, and journey mapping.
             _Have Completed_: Have received feedback about the scope and academic requirements for the project and made adjustments. Completed two research activities with real participants (topic interviews about needs). Finalized software and frameworks to use and begin building a system design strategy for implementation.
    
  October:
  <br>
  - 1st- **Define**: Problem statements and constraints
             _Have Completed_: Decide what prototype pieces are necessary for October 15th. Begin planning of small-scale prototypes that are usable for user testing. Mostly about back-end design and functionality.
  - 8th- **Ideate I**: Divergent Sketching- sketch 20 possible ideas and pick the top three most viable.
             _Have Completed_: Finalize what the app will actually be able to do. Divergent sketching activity is for front-end UI and user experience. Have framework of working prototype with limited front end OR have only front end to enable user testing.
  - 15th- **Ideate II: Prototype**: Refine builds, prepare test plan, TESTS CONDUCTED IN CLASS
             _Have Completed_: Have finalized the design of prototype front end in Figma- Non-functional but has all necessary components. Continue to work on backend system design. 
 - 29th- **Prototype 1**: Build low fidelity prototype.
             _Have Completed_: Have working prototypes of the front end for user testing. Have a feasible back-end system structure. Conduct testing and document design flaws. 

  November:
<br>
 - 5th- **Prototype 1**: Build low fidelity prototype.
             _Have Completed_: Have working prototypes of the front end for user testing. Have a feasible back-end system structure. Conduct testing and document design flaws.
 - 12th- **Iterate**: Iterate changes, risk and feasibility check, plan high fidelity build
             _Have Completed_: Refine front-end with info gained from prototype day. Have the backend be usable (sending correct data, real-time data display, downloadable on phone). Begin to combine front and back-end design. 
 - 19th- **High Fidelity Build**: High fidelity prototype, draft, and installation, peer critique
             _Have Completed_: Have the back and front end combined seamlessly. Conduct further user testing and risk/QA testing
 - 26th- **Rehearsal**: Narrative, demo logistics, finalize journal.
             _Have Completed_: Final debugging and user experience testing finished.
   
  December:
  <br>
  - TBD: **Final Presentations**
             _Have Completed_: Narrative hook, practiced presentation, have a working prototype on phones able to be shown. 

### Materials/Frameworks
For prototyping, using a widget based framework such as figma or flutterflow will be advanatageous since our UI will be a key component in the construction of this app. We will then need to emulate different mobile devices through a mobile emulator and test different API calls on each to make sure it is cross compatible. Coding tools and API libraries will definitely be required and to simplify workflow we will be sharing the project on GitHub to facilitate teamwork. 

**Tools**: Flutterflow (app builder with UI and Backend capabilities), Figma (for UI creation and branding mood board), GitHub (version control and deploymet)
