#  Process Journal - Part 1 
## Overview
This documentation is the guidelines and process for the creation of the app *Unplug*. This app helps promote a lower screen time, something that has been affecting newer generations more predominantly. The goal is to gamify wanting a lower screen time by creating a simple app that tracks a user's screen time and their friends. Ultimetely, the final result will allow youth to reclaim their lives and spend more time in the real world. 

## User Context and Insights
Initially, we needed to define what users were affected the most by their phones and who would benefit the most. After diving deep into research on phone addiction and average screen time by generation, this was made clear. [By age, Gen Z has the most screen time](https://backlinko.com/screen-time-statistics), meaning they should be are primary users. Gender, race, ethinicity, social class, etc. are not significant to this app but we do want to target all demographics within this age group, as well as older and younger generations if possible but keeping the focus to the most affected group. 

>Target Users : Young adults (Gen Z) struggling with phone addiction, seeking to better their focus, prioritization and social well-being.

### User Research Findings
To determine the struggles young adults face with phone addiction, we created a user form and sorted the responses using AI to parse the data [(view week #3)](/Lucas'%20WeeklyJournal/WeeklyJornal.md). These responses gave us insight on what users are struglling with, why they want to stop using their phone, and the need they have for something to assist them in quitting this addiction. Furthermore, we immersed ourselves with what our users would feel [(view week #2)](/Lucas'%20WeeklyJournal/WeeklyJornal.md) using our app by actually doing it ourselves. This allowed us to further our research and understand even more what our user's go through. These tests allowed us to view the problem through the lense of our users and create a problem statement based on empathy. 

## Problem Statement and Success Criteria
>How might we help Gen-Z reclaim time spent on their phones so they can enjoy their youth and spend time on things they want to do?

This problem statement encompasses the issues our generation faces and how we can reclaim our lost time. The goal of 'Unplug' is to disconnect the reliance on our phones and create a healthy, balanced relationship. 

Our goals:
> 1. Reduce user's screen time by a significant amount
> 2. Create a habit of wanting to reduce screen time
> 3. Create a gamification of reducing screen time
> 4. Ultimately, have users create a healthy relationship with their phones

If we can users achieve these goals this would solve their problems/addictions they have with their phones and create a proper balance of living in the real world and being comfortable using their phones. Our goal is to help our generation as much as possible so they no longer feel stressed about how they use their phones. 

## Selection Matrix - Screen Time App Concepts

### Concepts Overview

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Idea #1** | A focus on the statistical side of the application. Showing long term, short term and average screen time based on many factors and using AI to determine how to minimize screen time. |
| **Idea #2** | A gamified, social-focused app that encourages users to connect with friends, share progress, and compete in weekly challenges to reduce screen time together. Builds accountability and community. |
| **Idea #3** | A minimalistic approach to the daily, weekly and monthly screen time tracker. Compares with friends and tracks usages but only looks at the essentials keeping only significant information. |

**Selected Concept:** **Idea 3 - Unplug**

### Reasoning
**Idea #3/Unplug** provides the best balance between usability, motivation, and sustainability.  
While **Idea #1** offers advanced analytics and **Idea #2** focuses on social gamification, **Idea #3** excels in simplicity and clarity presenting essential data without overwhelming the user.  
Its provide a clean interface and simple, easy to use, functions that allow the user to not focus on the app but on their screen time. It provides similar functions to the other ideas but simplifies them and keeps the essential components which allow the user to reach their goals while not remaining on their phone for a long time. 

Furthermore, this idea's simplicity allows for the use of widgets, which let the user quickly/constantly check their screen time and not be occupied with viewing the UI of the app (examples to follow).

## Lo-fi Prototype
For our [low fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/YsV741BtZr4vviMWGTv08Z/Unplug?node-id=0-1&t=ErSZV50v68XLT3qO-1), we used Figma to collaborate together to develop a simple wireframe that would allow users to test a shell of the app. This, in the future, would let us determine if we are on the right path in the most efficient way to see what is working/what is not. It is easily modifyable and simple in nature to allow for changes as we go.

Using an AI plugin for the template and following idea #3 we created a widget based wireframe with the main functionalities of the app. I focused on the home page and statistics page, while my partner focused on the widget and friends page. Together we focused on the simple design and easy to use theme.

### The Widgets
With widgets, we aim to reduce the users active screen time on apps even more by giving access to the important app features just by looking at your home page:
<div align="center">

<img src="/Media/WidgetOnIOS.png" alt="widgetOnHomescreen" width="40%" />

<p><em>Widget Displayed on  iOS Home Screen</em></p>

</div>

<div align="center">

<img src="/Media/WidgetFunctionality.png" alt="widgetImage" width="100%" />

<p><em>Widget Functionality Overview</em></p>

</div>

### Home Page
The *Home* page has most of the esssential information of the app showcasing in focus the user's screen time and how much it has increased/decreased based on the previous day. On top of this, it has main stats such as what apps/activity you use the most, your friend's times, and your weekly average. It shows this info while keeping a simple format for ease of use/visibility. 
<div align="center">

<img src="/Media/HomeScreen.png" alt="homescreen" width="40%" />

<p><em>Home Screen Ovewview</em></p>

</div>

### Stats Page | Daily-Weekly-Monthly
The *Stats* page dives a little deeper on the user's activity with a focus on the time spent within a day, week or month on your phone and what impacts/insights that has had on your life. Tracking all essential information while still being simple enough for the users.
<div align="center">

<img src="/Media/StatsPage.png" alt="statspage" width="40%" />

<p><em>Stats Page Overview</em></p>

</div>

Dividing the information into 3 categories of time:

<div align="center">

<img src="/Media/WeeklyMonthlyPage.png" alt="monthlypage" width="40%" />

<p><em>Daily, Weekly and Monthly Long Term Tracking</em></p>

</div>

### Friends Page
The *Friends* page using a versus concept to gamify the app and how that competitive feeling. It uses simple bar graphs to compare how you are doing against your friends while still making it easy and accessible for the users to understand.
<div align="center">

<p><em>Friends Page Overview</em></p>

</div>

### Wireframe | Functionality
Finally, this low fidelity prototype is functional and will be tested with users in the upcoming weeks to determine what changes need to be made, what works, what doesn't, etc. 
<div align="center">

## Future Objectives 
With our low-fidelity prototype created and functional, our future objective will be to send it off to users, do usability testing, and determine what succeeds and what does not. This will allow us to keep re-iterating at a prototype level before commiting to final design and production. Collaboration and feedback from users will also help to design new features to ensure they add value without creating unnecessary distractions. The goal is to refine and expand the appâ€™s core functionality while maintaining its minimalistic approach and solving the needs of our users.
