## User and Context

Gen-Z is spending unprecedented amounts of time on their phone, with many referring to screen time as an unwilling addiction. My partner and I, eager to make a change to this issue, are looking to our generation for answers on what they need and want in order to curb their usage. Through a series of user research techniques (see Maya's Weekly Journal Week 3 for insights and spreadsheets), we have come to find three areas of challenge that our users are eager to address with their screen time usage: 

1. Lack of awareness of screen time led
2. Many wanted to lower their time but didn't know how
3. Many cited this as feeling like an 'addiction' 

These two insights led to the development of our two problem statements: 
**How might we help Gen-Z reclaim time spent on their phones so they can enjoy their youth and spend time on things they want to do?**

Our solution to this problem relies on awareness and social accountability to address the addiction aspect of this issue. 
For this midterm document I worked on the interaction design, widget design, and friends page while Lucas did the statistics and home page. 

## Success Criteria

Success for this project relies on user-centered approaches to addiction and recovery. We are not looking for people to stop using their phones altogether, but getting to a place they are happy about is key. Success would look like:
1. Lowering screen time by at least 20%
2. Users reporting that they feel more aware of their times and the times of their friends
3. Users feeling inclined to open the screen time app at least once a week to check progress, and/or having the screen time app as a widget on the home page

## Design Concepts and Lo-Fi Prototype Plans 

For our prototype plan, we made a wireframe app to communicate our desired functions on the app and how a user would interact with it. We focused on the interaction between pages, the required screens (Home, Friends, and Stats), and the widget that would be shown on the home screen of your device. Here I will discuss three important design decisions that we made and how they align with out goals and problem statement. 

**Design Choices:**
1. Making it a widget/app combination
2. Making it social to deal with accountability
3. Adding an in-depth statistics page that shows rate over time

### Widget-App Combination
Making this a widget-app combination allows us to address one of the big problems areas that we learned about in our user research: awareness. Many of the survey responses indicated that a large number of users were not aware that their screen time was so high. Most smart phones have a screen time graph in their settings but most users did not make the effort to regularly check. Therefore, we decided to make this an app that would display daily time usage and weekly average on the home screen of the device. 

**Here I have created a wireframe to show how the widget might look and it's afforded functionalities**

### Making it Social 
A large part of this project focuses on how accountability can help people with addiction. We have added a function where users' screen times are shared with their friends and so they can see how their time compares to the people around them. We have included visuals to help with a quick visual comparison of times between people.

### Adding long-term in-depth descriptions

The last important page of our app is the in-depth statistics page. This page collects data from each week and tracks it over the months that you have had the app. The goal of this page is to provide long-term awareness for their patterns of use and how much time it is taking out of their lives over the long term. It is not supposed to be a scare tactic but instead is supposed to provide an accurate view of their usage.

**Here is an image of the Stats page the Lucas designed that tracks usage by what apps are being used the most**

**Here Lucas has created pages for daily, weekly, and monthly charts tracking usage over those time periods. These pages also include the total amount of screen time per week and month. This metric is something that we have not seen included in many screen time tracking applications, and we believe it is a very missed opportunity to increase awareness about actual total times that people are spending on phones.**
