## User and Context

Gen-Z is spending unprecedented amounts of time on their phone, with many referring to screen time as an unwilling addiction. My partner and I, eager to make a change to this issue, are looking to our generation for answers on what they need and want in order to curb their usage. Through a series of user research techniques (see Maya's Weekly Journal Week 3 for insights and spreadsheets), we have come to find three areas of challenge that our users are eager to address with their screen time usage: 

1. Lack of awareness of screen time led
2. Many wanted to lower their time but didn't know how
3. Many cited this as feeling like an 'addiction' 

These two insights led to the development of our two problem statements: 
**How might we help Gen-Z reclaim time spent on their phones so they can enjoy their youth and spend time on things they want to do?**

Our solution to this problem relies on awareness and social accountability to address the addiciton aspect of this issue. 

## Success Criteria

Success for this project relies on user-centered approaches to addiction and recovery. We are not looking for people to stop using their phones altogether, but getting to a place they are happy about is key. Success would look like:
1. Lowering screen time by at least 20%
2. Users reporting that they feel more aware of their times and the times of their friends
3. Users feeling inclined to open the screen time app at least once a week to check progress, and/or having the screen time app as a widget on the home page

## Concepts with Selection Matrix

## Lo-Fi Prototype Plan

For our prototype plan, we made a wireframe app to communicate our desired functions on the app and how a user would interact with it.
