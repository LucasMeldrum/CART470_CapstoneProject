# Final App!
Our final application ended up taking two forms: a high-fidelity working prototype on Figma and real working code that can send, receive, and store screen time data. After working through both the development of the user interface design and the actual implementation of the app, we decided that to properly portray the design changes we found in our user testing, we would need to create another interface on Figma. Both aspects of the prototype were incredibly important to our ability to portray, understand, and test our app and hold real value when expressing the idea to others. 

## User Interface: Designing for our Audience

In Week 7 of our weekly journals, we described four pain points/points of interest that interviewees had with our initial prototype:

1. Widget Clock Logo Communication
2. Graph Readability and Necessity
3. The Stats They Always Wanted!
4. Data Privacy

For the development of our final prototype, we keep these points in mind as our driving force to create a user-friendly and genuinely impactful application-- something people would really use. Here are our amendments:
