# Final App!
Our final application ended up taking two forms: a high-fidelity working prototype on Figma and real working code that can send, receive, and store screen time data. After working through both the development of the user interface design and the actual implementation of the app, we decided that to properly portray the design changes we found in our user testing, we would need to create another interface on Figma. Both aspects of the prototype were incredibly important to our ability to portray, understand, and test our app and hold real value when expressing the idea to others. 

## User Interface: Designing for our Audience

In Week 7 of our weekly journals, we described four pain points/points of interest that interviewees had with our initial prototype:

1. Basic App Interface Improvements
2. Graph Readability and Necessity
3. The Stats They Always Wanted!
4. Data Privacy

For the development of our final prototype, we keep these points in mind as our driving force to create a user-friendly and genuinely impactful application-- something people would really use. Here are our amendments:

**1. Basic App Interface Improvements**   
- Made the Stats page easier to navigate using a slider bar at the top of the page.
- Changed colors and simplified design and graphs.

**2. Graph Readability and Necessity**
- Changed the Daily, Weekly, and Monthly graphs to have more visual information on the X and Y axis for better visual communication
- Changed the "Most Used Apps" widget on the front page to a bar graph showing screen time use throughout the week


**3. The Stats They Always Wanted!**
- Included more in-depth long-term stats like "This Day/Week/Month" stat graph as well as an "Average Day/Week/Month" stat graph.
- Allowed for long-term stat sharing between friends-- requestable on the Friends page
- Put the stats that were the most liked during interviews on the front page AND the stats page (Pickups per day and average session)

**4. Data Privacy**
- Added a "Data Privacy" setting on the front and friends pages. Linked to a pop up where users cna choose to stop sharing their short and long term statistics with their friends.
- Only friends are able to see stats.
- Some friends' long terms stats are not visible on friends page to show this feature.
