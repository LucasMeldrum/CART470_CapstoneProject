# Capstone Project Proposal

this is the beginning of the project proposal

Submit your final project proposal; include a description and timeline, as well as details surrounding its material, space, and time requirements. Be thorough.

This should follow the same structure as your weekly design journal submission. Each week, you must upload new pages as you add them to your journal, demonstrating your progress.
