# Week 1

_September 17th_
### Description
 Gen Z is seeing an unprecedented new addiction: screen time. With young people, including ourselves, spending anywhere from 3-7 hours per day on their phones, many different apps and self-improvement mantras have been trying to help. I, personally, have tried many different routes to decreasing my screen time, but have only found one that actually works: accountability. For our capstone, we are attempting to create a mobile application that can track and share screen time data across different users with the idea of gamification and a fun/interactive UI. The goal is to allow users a tool to better monitor their own and their friends' screen times to add accountability to addiction. 
 ## Designing for the Socialization of Self-Improvement
 Beyond this being just a screen time tracker, we are  planning on making your score shareable between friends. For a few months, our team has been taking part in a weekly screen time challenge where the person with the highest screen time each week loses the challenge. In all of our attempts to lower our screentime, this has been the only effective process. Our main design goal for this project is to create a virtual space where sociability and accountability build awareness of patterns. 
 ## Aspects of Design
 We will do more brainstorming and feasibility narrowing but roughly our app wil include:
 1. Front page interface describing screen time usage for the week and average weekly use (like on IOS devices)
 2. Social page to see the scores of friend accounts
 3. Visual calendar to track usage over longer periods of time (can hold up to months worth of tracking)

<br>

Furthermore, screen time will be organized into categories depending on what your phone has been used for. For example, Intstagram, Facebook, Reddit, etc. will be categorized into social media, while Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, etc. will be put into navigation/maps. This separation of categories is significant since certain apps have less active monitoring (such as a GPS or music) and are used while doing other tasks, whilst others require your full attention.


# Week 2

_September 24th_ 

**Empathy Interview**
  - Interview with Rachel
    1. 5 hours average
    2. 6.8 hours average
    3. Silencing phone, deleting most used apps, brute force
    4. Instagram, Messenger, YouTube
  - Interview with Jocelyne
    1. 2 hours average
    2. 3.6 hours average
    3. Not much, attempted to leave phone at home sometimes
    4. YouTube, Texting, Instagram
## Questions:
1. What do you guess your screen time is?
2. What is your actual average screen time?
3. What methods have you used to try to lower it? Have they worked?
4. What apps are your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most used in terms of screen time?

## Immersion
Since we both grew up in the age of the iphone, both of us have struggle with our screen times. Last year, I was consistently pulling average times of 3-5 hours daily, taking up almost half of my free time each day. I have tried many different ways to get this down, including deleting addictive apps (Instagram, Reddit, or YouTube), keeping my phone on silent during the day, and just straight up going out without my phone. These helped in some ways but I would always find myself coming back to my phone. 

Throughout the past year, Lucas and I have been experimenting with adding accountability into our journey to get off our phones. Accountability in addiction is an overwhelmingly useful strategy for minimizing risk due to social pressures. A study from [The Phoenix Recovery Center](https://thephoenixrc.com/blog/addiction-recovery/accountability-in-recovery/) stresses the importance of internal as well as external accountability for its patients as a crucial aspect to getting clean and staying clean. Even though we aren't hardcore alcoholics, we still decided to try this out in our efforts, and the results were fantastic. 

### Accountability Experiment
Each week, we calculate our own average daily screen time and then compare it with each other. The person with the higher screen time has to pay $10 into our mutual relationship savings fund that we have been keeping for a year. The results were immediate; during weeks 1-3 our average screen times dropped around 2.5 hours each, hovering around an average 1.8-2 hours. After the first month, they increased a bit to an average of 2.5-3 hours per day and has remained steady at that point for around two months. The accountability with each other, as well as the imminent financial threat, was the only thing that actually consistently changed our outcome.

### Design Concepts 
1. How can we design for accountability through socialization and competition (biggest loser?)
2. How can we design for accountability through visibility (always aware of your screen time in some way, making it something people consider and think about. Can people accurately guess their own screen time?
3. How can we create a simple interface that isn't overwhelming and makes it easy for people to check their screen time and that of their friends?
4. People obviously want to lower their screentime, but what is the barrier? Why have they been trying with no success, and how can we bypass the mental block?

# Week 3

_October 1st_

**Define**


[Spreadsheet for Screentime Usage](url)


After our interviews and survey we were able to take away real problem statements from real people. Our take aways where as follows:
1. Phone users don't realize how much time they are spending on their phone.
2. 95% of responders said they would like to lower their screen time but can't.
3. We will be focusing on Gen-Z usage and their concerns around reclaiming their free time. 

**Problem Statements:**
- How might we help Gen-Z reclaim time spent on their phones so they can enjoy their youth and spend time on things they want to do?
- How might we make people more consistently aware of their screen time in order to help them make more informed decisions?
- How might we address the addiction aspect of screen time and users' seeming inability to keep themselves off screens?

**Data Synthesis with ChatGPT**
<br>
_Prompt 1_: Here are answers to a Google form we sent about Gen-Z's screen time usage. The question was: Would you want to lower your screen time? What are some patterns from this data that may help us understand the usage of young people's screen time?
1. Desire vs Difficulty
2. Phone as a habit/addiction
3. Multipurpose use makes it tricky (some users use their phone for work or school)
   - "But these “necessary” uses often lead to distractions (e.g., checking the weather → 10 reels in)" -GPT
5. Emotional and Situational Triggers
   - Many mention boredom or using it as a distraction
   - Also unemployment and excess free time
6. Social Media as Biggest Hook
   - "TikTok, Instagram Reels, and scrolling are the main culprits mentioned."

Lowest: 2.45 hr per day

# Week 4

_October 8th_

**Ideate 1**

**Brainstorming**

For this week, with our problem space in mind, I sketched a series of concepts that could be used for the final product. I was trying to create a large breadth of ideas, some not very feasible, just to broaden our range of thinking. Many of the ideas involved different visual graphs and techniques for relaying the information we wanted users to become more aware of. Other ideas revolved around the social aspect of the app and how we could encourage or discourage phone use by allowing others to see your screen time. The concepts ofter were iOS-based and developed as widgets for the phone screen, effectively making it a piece of your daily routine that is accessible at all times. Something that is always in your face. 

Another question for us was whether we wanted to encourage less use or discourage use. The tone and the way the app handles too much use (in a positive reinforcement way or a negative punishing way) could set the stage for the tone of the entire app.

Seeing the ideas in visuals instead of just written or spoken provided us with a more concrete way to think about our designs. For next week, we are aiming to narrow down three concepts that we want to execute in the final application (we want to keep it simple and effective) and provide a full visual and commented representation of how that might look. This will translate to a working prototype created on Figma the week after. 

I have also included a basic mood board that shows some of the visuals we saw and were inspired by when designing our app. They are different forms of graphs and IOS widgets. This was important to gather inspiration as well as understand the limits and affordances of the IOS app widget space.

**Final Concepts** 

Finally, we chose three concepts from the brainstorm that we would like to include in our final and drew out the ideas that would be important to create in our first prototype.

# Week 5

**See Design Process Journal 1**


# Week 6

**Prototype 1**

For this week, we are testing our app's wireframe with real users who can give feedback on usability and what features they like and don't like. 

Our objectives are to:
1. Find usability errors and confusion
2. See what features users enjoy and what they don't
3. See if they think it would actually be helpful
4. Gain constructive feedback for next iteration

We were able to do three interviews with people ages 18-24. In these interviews we employed the loose interview structure outlined in Lucas's Weekly Report to gain feedback on our preliminary wireframe. Here were some of the most important points of feedback for the next iteration:

### 1. Widget-clock logo communication

The design for our circular widget was supposed to show time awake, time asleep, and the time that is taken out of your day on you phone. We designed it like this to attempt to show people a more realistic view of the proportion of time that is being taken from their day since, for at least a third of the day, they are sleeping. This however, was not communicated well with the visual provided. Users stated that the intention made sense once it was explained but was not obvious. They liked the idea of seeing the proportion with sleeping included but a better illustration will need to be developed. 

Solutions may include:
- Reworking the image so that it is just a 12 hour clock instead of 24 so that it is more readable
- Adding numbers to the clock face
- Instead of a clock, using another visual like a water cup being filled up
- Adding text such as "Time Awake", "Time Asleep", "Time on Phone" or numbers to show these hours

### 2. Graph Readability and Necessity

On the stats page, users complained that the graphs were not very readable and comprehensible. The graphs that lacked a Y axis (that would show the amount of time actually spent) and just had the months or weeks on the x axis, were too simple and needed more visual information. The graph for the monthly average is shown below for an example of this issue. They said they would like all the months to be labeled, not just every other, and would like to see the hour count on the Y axis of the graph. 

<div align="center">

<img src="/Media/MonthlyAverageGraphClose.png" alt="widgetImage" width="40%" />

<p><em>Monthly Graph Issue</em></p>

</div>

There was also a portion of the home page that interviewees agreed seemed not very necessary. One user said that instead of this chart they would have prefered to have the monthly or weekly graph in this spot on the home page. 

<div align="center">

<img src="/Media/TimeSpendClose.png" alt="widgetImage" width="40%" />

<p><em>Chart of Time Spend on Certain Apps</em></p>

</div>

Solutions may include:
- Adding more words and numbers to the simple graphs
- Replacing the home page chart with the weekly graph


### 3. The Stats They Always Wanted!

One interviewee reported that her interest in the app was less centered around the social aspect and more around the ability to see long term screen time statistics and trends. She said that she would place a high importance on seeing the months, weeks, and maybe even years of her trending statistics. She said she would enjoy being able to see the statics of her friends aswell. She also said that she really liked the 'Pickups Per Day' number and wanted to make sure that stayed in the final version. 

Solutions may include:
- Adding long term statitics sharing between friends
- Pushing the 'Pickups per day' number to the home screen as well as the stats and friends page


### 4. Data Privacy

A user described wanting a more fleshed out idea of how friending others would work and to make sure that random people would not be able to use or see her data. She said she would only be likely to use the app if you needed to approve friends and wanted to option to turn off sharing her screen time.

Solutions may include:
- Adding a figma interface to show users how they would add friends and the need to accept a friend request
- Adding a feature to stop sharing your data to your friends
- Making sure users are aware of the privacy settings that are in place


_The insights from this interview will guide us towards our design sprint next week. We will be focusing on solutions to these issues and while also taking into account the parts that users most liked. Our goal for the next week will be to have a plan and visual mock ups for our proposed solutions. The week after we will have a finalized UI that implements these design solutions. _
