# Week 1
### Description
 Gen Z is seeing an unprecedented new addiction: screen time. With young people, including ourselves, spending anywhere from 3-7 hours per day on their phones, many different apps and self-improvement mantras have been trying to help. I, personally, have tried many different routes to decreasing my screen time, but have only found one that actually works: accountability. For our capstone, we are attempting to create a mobile application that can track and share screen time data across different users with the idea of gamification and a fun/interactive UI. The goal is to allow users a tool to better monitor their own and their friends' screen times to add accountability to addiction. 
 ## Designing for the Socialization of Self-Improvement
 Beyond this being just a screen time tracker, we are  planning on making your score shareable between friends. For a few months, our team has been taking part in a weekly screen time challenge where the person with the highest screen time each week loses the challenge. In all of our attempts to lower our screentime, this has been the only effective process. Our main design goal for this project is to create a virtual space where sociability and accountability build awareness of patterns. 
 ## Aspects of Design
 We will do more brainstorming and feasibility narrowing but roughly our app wil include:
 1. Front page interface describing screen time usage for the week and average weekly use (like on IOS devices)
 2. Social page to see the scores of friend accounts
 3. Visual calendar to track usage over longer periods of time (can hold up to months worth of tracking)

<br>

Furthermore, screen time will be organized into categories depending on what your phone has been used for. For example, Intstagram, Facebook, Reddit, etc. will be categorized into social media, while Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, etc. will be put into navigation/maps. This separation of categories is significant since certain apps have less active monitoring (such as a GPS or music) and are used while doing other tasks, whilst others require your full attention.


# Week 2
**Empathy Interview**
  - Interview with Rachel
    1. 5 hours average
    2. 6.8 hours average
    3. Silencing phone, deleting most used apps, brute force
    4. Instagram, Messenger, YouTube
  - Interview with Jocelyne
    1. 2 hours average
    2. 3.6 hours average
    3. Not much, attempted to leave phone at home sometimes
    4. YouTube, Texting, Instagram
## Questions:
1. What do you guess your screen time is?
2. What is your actual average screen time?
3. What methods have you used to try to lower it? Have they worked?
4. What apps are your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most used in terms of screen time?

## Immersion
Since we both grew up in the age of the iphone, both of us have struggle with our screen times. Last year, I was consistently pulling average times of 3-5 hours daily, taking up almost half of my free time each day. I have tried many different ways to get this down, including deleting addictive apps (Instagram, Reddit, or YouTube), keeping my phone on silent during the day, and just straight up going out without my phone. These helped in some ways but I would always find myself coming back to my phone. 

Throughout the past year, Lucas and I have been experimenting with adding accountability into our journey to get off our phones. Accountability in addiction is an overwhelmingly useful strategy for minimizing risk due to social pressures. A study from [The Phoenix Recovery Center](https://thephoenixrc.com/blog/addiction-recovery/accountability-in-recovery/) stresses the importance of internal as well as external accountability for its patients as a crucial aspect to getting clean and staying clean. Even though we aren't hardcore alcoholics, we still decided to try this out in our efforts, and the results were fantastic. 

### Accountability Experiment
Each week, we calculate our own average daily screen time and then compare it with each other. The person with the higher screen time has to pay $10 into our mutual relationship savings fund that we have been keeping for a year. The results were immediate; during weeks 1-3 our average screen times dropped around 2.5 hours each, hovering around an average 1.8-2 hours. After the first month, they increased a bit to an average of 2.5-3 hours per day and has remained steady at that point for around two months. The accountability with each other, as well as the imminent financial threat, was the only thing that actually consistently changed our outcome.

### Design Concepts 
1. How can we design for accountability through socialization and competition (biggest loser?)
2. How can we design for accountability through visibility (always aware of your screen time in some way, making it something people consider and think about. Can people accurately guess their own screen time?
3. How can we create a simple interface that isn't overwhelming and makes it easy for people to check their screen time and that of their friends?
4. People obviously want to lower their screentime, but what is the barrier? Why have they been trying with no success, and how can we bypass the mental block?

# Week 3
**Define**


[Spreadsheet for Screentime Usage](url)


After our interviews and survey we were able to take away real problem statements from real people. Our take aways where as follows:
1. Phone users don't realize how much time they are spending on their phone.
2. 95% of responders said they would like to lower their screen time but can't.
3. We will be focusing on Gen-Z usage and their concerns around reclaiming their free time. 

**Problem Statements:**
- How might we help Gen-Z reclaim time spent on their phones so they can enjoy their youth and spend time on things they want to do?
- How might we make people more consistently aware of their screen time in order to help them make more informed decisions?
- How might we address the addiction aspect of screen time and users' seeming inability to keep themselves off screens?

**Data Synthesis with ChatGPT**
<br>
_Prompt 1_: Here are answers to a Google form we sent about Gen-Z's screen time usage. The question was: Would you want to lower your screen time? What are some patterns from this data that may help us understand the usage of young people's screen time?
1. Desire vs Difficulty
2. Phone as a habit/addiction
3. Multipurpose use makes it tricky (some users use their phone for work or school)
   - "But these “necessary” uses often lead to distractions (e.g., checking the weather → 10 reels in)" -GPT
5. Emotional and Situational Triggers
   - Many mention boredom or using it as a distraction
   - Also unemployment and excess free time
6. Social Media as Biggest Hook
   - "TikTok, Instagram Reels, and scrolling are the main culprits mentioned."

Based on the data most used apps are: Social Media, Texting and Facetiming, and Watching Shows

_Prompt 2_: Here are the average daily times from users 3 hours. What are some trends and insights you have gained from this?
<br>
Mean: ~6 hr per day
<br>
Highest: 16 hr per day
<br>
Lowest: 2.45 hr per day

# Week 4
**Ideate 1**

For this week, with our problem space in mind, I sketched a series of concepts that could be used for the final product. I was trying to create a large breadth of ideas, some not very feasible, just to broaden our range of thinking. Many of the ideas involved different visual graphs and techniques for relaying the information we wanted users to become more aware of. Other ideas revolved around the social aspect of the app and how we could encourage or discourage phone use by allowing others to see your screen time. The concepts ofter were iOS-based and developed as widgets for the phone screen, effectively making it a piece of your daily routine that is accessible at all times. Something that is always in your face. 

Another question for us was whether we wanted to encourage less use or discourage use. The tone and the way the app handles too much use (in a positive reinforcement way or a negative punishing way) could set the stage for the tone of the entire app.

Seeing the ideas in visuals instead of just written or spoken provided us with a more concrete way to think about our designs. For next week, we are aiming to narrow down three concepts that we want to execute in the final application (we want to keep it simple and effective) and provide a full visual and commented representation of how that might look. This will translate to a working prototype created on Figma the week after. 

I have also included a basic mood board that shows some of the visuals we saw and were inspired by when designing our app. They are different forms of graphs and IOS widgets. This was important to gather inspiration as well as understand the limits and affordances of the IOS app widget space.
