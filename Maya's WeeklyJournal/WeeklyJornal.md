# Week 1
### Description
 Gen Z is seeing an unprecedented new addiction: screen time. With young people, including ourselves, spending anywhere from 3-7 hours per day on their phones, many different apps and self-improvement mantras have been trying to help. I, personally, have tried many different routes to decreasing my screen time, but have only found one that actually works: accountability. For our capstone, we are attempting to create a mobile application that can track and share screen time data across different users with the idea of gamification and a fun/interactive UI. The goal is to allow users a tool to better monitor their own and their friends' screen times to add accountability to addiction. 
 ## Designing for the Socialization of Self-Improvement
 Beyond this being just a screen time tracker, we are  planning on making your score shareable between friends. For a few months, our team has been taking part in a weekly screen time challenge where the person with the highest screen time each week loses the challenge. In all of our attempts to lower our screentime, this has been the only effective process. Our main design goal for this project is to create a virtual space where sociability and accountability build awareness of patterns. 
 ## Aspects of Design
 We will do more brainstorming and feasibility narrowing but roughly our app wil include:
 1. Front page interface describing screen time usage for the week and average weekly use (like on IOS devices)
 2. Social page to see the scores of friend accounts
 3. Visual calendar to track usage over longer periods of time (can hold up to months worth of tracking)

Furthermore, screen time will be organized into categories depending on what your phone has been used for. For example, Intstagram, Facebook, Reddit, etc. will be categorized into social media, while Google Maps, Apple Maps, Waze, etc. will be put into navigation/maps. This separation of categories is significant since certain apps have less active monitoring (such as a GPS or music) and are used while doing other tasks, whilst others require your full attention.


# Week 2
**Empathy Interview**
  - Interview with Rachel
    1. 5 hours average
    2. 6.8 hours average
    3. Silencing phone, deleting most used apps, brute force
    4. Instagram, Messenger, YouTube
  - Interview with Jocelyne
    1. 2 hours average
    2. 3.6 hours average
    3. Not much, attempted to leave phone at home sometimes
    4. YouTube, Texting, Instagram
## Questions:
1. What do you guess your screen time is?
2. What is your actual average screen time?
3. What methods have you used to try to lower it? Have they worked?
4. What apps are your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most used in terms of screen time?

## Immersion
Since we both grew up in the age of the iphone, both of us have struggle with our screen times. Last year, I was consistently pulling average times of 3-5 hours daily, taking up almost half of my free time each day. I have tried many different ways to get this down, including deleting addictive apps (Instagram, Reddit, or YouTube), keeping my phone on silent during the day, and just straight up going out without my phone. These helped in some ways but I would always find myself coming back to my phone. 

Throughout the past year, Lucas and I have been experimenting with adding accountability into our journey to get off our phones. Accountability in addiction is an overwhelmingly useful strategy for minimizing risk due to social pressures. A study from [The Phoenix Recovery Center](https://thephoenixrc.com/blog/addiction-recovery/accountability-in-recovery/) stresses the importance of internal as well as external accountability for its patients as a crucial aspect to getting clean and staying clean. Even though we aren't hardcore alcoholics, we still decided to try this out in our efforts, and the results were fantastic. 

### Accountability Experiment
Each week, we calculate our own average daily screen time and then compare it with each other. The person with the higher screen time has to pay $10 into our mutual relationship savings fund that we have been keeping for a year. The results were immediate; during weeks 1-3 our average screen times dropped around 2.5 hours each, hovering around an average 1.8-2 hours. After the first month, they increased a bit to an average of 2.5-3 hours per day and has remained steady at that point for around two months. The accountability with each other, as well as the imminent financial threat, was the only thing that actually consistently changed our outcome.

### Design Concepts 
1. How can we design for accountability through socialization and competition (biggest loser?)
2. How can we design for accountability through visibility (always aware of your screen time in some way, making it something people consider and think about. Can people accurately guess their own screen time?
3. How can we create a simple interface that isn't overwhelming and makes it easy for people to check their screen time and that of their friends?
4. People obviously want to lower their screentime, but what is the barrier? Why have they been trying with no success, and how can we bypass the mental block?
