**Empathy Interview**
  - Interview with Rachel
  - Interview with Jocelyne
## Questions:
1. What do you guess your screen time is?
2. What is your actual average screen time?
3. What methods have you used to try to lower it? Have they worked?
4. What apps are your 1st, 2nd, and 3rd most used in terms of screen time?

## Immersion
Since we both grew up in the age of the iphone, both of us have struggle with our screen times. Last year, I was consistently pulling average times of 3-5 hours daily, taking up almost half of my free time each day. I have tried many different ways to get this down, including deleting addictive apps (Instagram, Reddit, or YouTube), keeping my phone on silent during the day, and just straight up going out without my phone. These helped in some ways but I would always find myself coming back to my phone. 

Throughout the past year, Lucas and I have been experimenting with adding accountability into our journey to get off our phones. Accountability in addiction is an overwhelmingly useful strategy for minimizing risk due to social pressures. A study from [The Phoenix Recovery Center](https://thephoenixrc.com/blog/addiction-recovery/accountability-in-recovery/) stresses the importance of internal as well as external accountability for its patients as a crucial aspect to getting clean and staying clean. Even though we aren't hardcore alcoholics, we still decided to try this out in our efforts, and the results were fantastic. 

### Accountability Experiment
Each week, we calculate our own average daily screen time and then compare it with each other. The person with the higher screen time has to pay $10 into our mutual relationship savings fund that we have been keeping for a year. The results were immediate; during weeks 1-3 our average screen times dropped around 2.5 hours each, hovering around an average 1.8-2 hours. After the first month, they increased a bit to an average of 2.5-3 hours per day and has remained steady at that point for around two months. The accountability with each other, as well as the imminent financial threat, was the only thing that actually consistently changed our outcome.

### Design Concepts 
1. How can we design for accountability through socialization and competition (biggest loser?)
2. How can we design for accountability through visibility (always aware of your screen time in some way, making it something people consider and think about. Can people accurately guess their own screen time?
3. How can we create a simple interface that isn't overwhelming and makes it easy for people to check their screen time and that of their friends?
